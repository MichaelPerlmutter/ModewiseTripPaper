# ModewiseTripPaper
This code is meant to accompany the paper "Modewise Operators, the Tensor Restricted Isometry Property, and Low-Rank Tensor Recovery"

The ExperimentsVec.ipynb is a jupyter notebook implementing a vectorization based approach as described in ``Low rank tensor recovery via iterative hard thresholding" by Holger Rauhut, Reinhold Schneider, and Zeljka Stojanac. ExperimentsTWOSTEP uses the two-stage compression algorithm detailed in the paper. For both methods we consider applications of the Tensor Restricted Isometry Property to Iterative Hard Thresholding.

To run the code, select parameters in the top cell and press "restart and run all." Results will be displayed at the bottom and also saved in a csv file.
